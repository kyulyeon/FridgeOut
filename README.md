# Fridge Out
Fridge Out is a mobile application developed using Flutter for BCIT's Winter 2021 Hackathon Project.

The premise of this application is to solve a key problem relating to food waste. 
Most of the waste — or 61 per cent — happens in households. To solve this issue, we created 


Fridge Out – a solution to solving wasted food produces.


Most recipes offered through a simple good search of recipes book requires an individual to have already purchased the specific ingredients; however,
instead of wasting time and money gathering the required ingredients, Fridge Out will offer recipe suggestions based on the user's available 
ingredients found in their fridge.


Due to the nature of a Hackathon, there is no backend linked to this application; as a result, all data are hard coded in
